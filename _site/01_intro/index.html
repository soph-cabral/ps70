<h3>Week 1: Final Project Proposal</h3>

<p class="margin">   </p>
At the moment, I have two main ideas for my final project.

<p class="margin">   </p>
<h4>Idea: Macro Keypad with Encoder Wheels</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
The first would be a small macro keypad, with probably around 8 single keys
and two clickable encoder wheels. The main goal of this keypad would be to make
it faster for me to program on lighting consoles like the ETC Ion, which use a
command-line syntax. The nature of lighting programming means there are often
repetetive commands that require lots of keypresses, obscure softkeys reached
through menus, or both, so professional programmers often create macro sequences
to improve their efficiency.

<p class="margin">   </p>
Ideally, I would create a mechanical keypad with a matching interface that would
allow me to assign and reassign the keys to various macros or other command
sequences. This would involve a programmable interface housed in an enclosure
with several mechanical keys and two or more encoder wheels. If possible, it
would be cool if the keypad were wireless via Bluetooth or a similar protocol.
And in an ambitious world, the keypad would also be able to switch between
multiple profiles so that I could use it for everyday work in addition
to lighting.

<h4>Idea: Bluetooth Speaker with Timer</h4>

<p class="margin">   </p>
I often like to listen to a noise generator or music as I fall asleep. The noise
generator app I use has a built-in timer functionality that pauses playback after
a set amount of time to prevent it from playing all night, but Spotify (which I
use for music) does not. I'm not sure how feasible it would be, but I would like
to build a device that could play music from my phone and automatically pause it
after a certain amount of time.

<p class="margin">   </p>
I would love for this to be a physical speaker with a built-in display screen and
some buttons, where I could access all the normal music playback functions
(play/pause, volume up/down, skip forward/backward) as well as controls for starting
and stopping a custom-length timer to pause playback. Additionally, it would be cool
if the device could slowly fade out the music over a period of time as another
option besides a hard pause.
